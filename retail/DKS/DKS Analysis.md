# Company (DKS)

## Summary and Recommendation

#### Reasons to Invest

- DKS is the largest sports retailer in a highly fragmented US market for the sporting goods industry.  They have diffentiated themselves by offering higher quality premium items. They have cultivated strong relationships with National Brands who are attempting to narrow their sales channel and focus on their D2C business models.

	- this puts DKS in a strong position against their competitors as they have access to premium items from National Brand partners where and they can acheive higher margins with little promotional pressure.

<br>


- DKS investments in e-commerce, omni-channel and supply chain has propelled them to #1 spot of multi brand sporting goods retailer where many have fell since 2015. They offer a differentiated shopping expierence.

- Management continues to maintain the company's financial health which has allowed them to outperform and acquire failed competitors in the past (The sports authority). They have recently secured long-term debt financing to enhance their liquidity in times of uncertainty.

#### Risks

- slowing retail demand due to tightening of monetary policy?

- how much demand was pull forward from the pandemic?

- buyback policy

	- in 2020 they paused buybacks to preserve liquidity, but stock was relatively cheaper then

	- in 2021 they spent a lot on buybacks to try to catch up

	- monitor their buyback moves and how it is affecting shareholder value

- largest sporting goods retailer in the US

- Took over a lot of failing sports store in the mid 2010s (i.e sports authority) :+1:

	- they overtook sports authority as largest retailer in 2008

#### PEST Analysis <a name="pest"></a>

    - N/A

- ##### Economic

	- fed tightening affect on consumer demand?

	- In May 2022 retail sales started to slip

    - after pandemic, people are prioritizing health and wellness even more?

- ##### Technological

	- ecommerce and omni channel will be key to driving sales in the future

		- DKS has been investing their capex in this field as far back as 2011-2012 when they launched their mobile app

#### Porter 5 Forces <a name="porter"></a>

- ##### Competition

- ##### New Entrants

    	- since 2010 brick and mortar stores have come and gone and DKS has emerged as the leader

	    - DKS has the real estate and long history of investment into their omni-channel ecommerce

	    - a new entrant in the multi-brand retail space is unlikely due to the large amounts of capital and strategic real-estate needed to compete with DKS's established omni-channel and distribution

	- the new entrant of concern is big Manufactuers (i.e Nike and Adidas) going D2C and how much that will eat out of their marketshare

- ##### Power of suppliers

	- DKS purchases from 1400 vendors, it has strong bargaining power

	- Even a huge brand like NKE who is focusing more on D2C, DKS remains one of their "strategic partners" and even integrated their membership program with DKS's

- ##### Power of customers

	- With Manufactuerers narrowing their distribution channels - DKS has more exclusive access to premium items from national brands. This allows them to avoid promotional pressure on higher margin items

- ##### Threat of substitute products

	- Manufactuers gaining more share in their D2C strategies

## Risks <a name="risks"></a>

- macro economic conditions

	- slowing economic activity due to Feds tightening moneytary policy

	- no more stimulus

	- how much demand was pull forward by the pandemic?

- are covid trends here to stay, return to office?

- continued supply chain pressures as many products are manufactuered overseas

- foreign relation tensions as well with China & Russia

- buybacks

	- 2020 they paused buybacks, and in 2021 they tried to make up the lack of purchases from previous years but the share price had gone up alot, net increase of %18 in share count! Not enough to offset :-1:

	- but it was pretty good, averageing -5% prior to pandemic

- brands are narrowing their distribution attempting to go direct to customer 

	- i.e Nike is moving towards D2C hope be have their business 60% D2C by 2025

	- but they still have a strong relationship with DKS

- success of their private label :thinking: 

- success of their specialty stores :thinking:

- significant knowledge and expierence in the Stack Family. Lauren Hobart is the 2nd CEO of DKS starting 2021

- a beneficial takeover may be hard if Stack family doesn't like it. :thinking:

	- also convertible notes has some terms and conditions that can make a take over harder

## Valuation <a name="valuation"></a>

- Assumptions

	- they expect to retain most of the margin gains since 2019 even with inflation headwinds this year

		- hence we chose an OCF margin of 7% to be ultra conservative for now

	- CFO - feels how well the consumer holds up is going to be the overriding factor, more than the bottom line

	- new yahoo projection indciated a low of revenue low of 9.36B vs 11B intially projection (-20% drop almost)

		- go with Yahoo low projection of -20% worse case, seems a bit too conservative to me?

		- look at 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q1, 7% sales drop, and their guidance is decrease of 2-8% in comp sales

	- capex input taken from their guidance of capex spending next year %2.9% of revenue

	- excluding working capital since the average is a source of cash :-1:

	- ![Assumptions](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4m2UGgKFi6sTpDPbzszDNjK-kmYbXzzPMnpDDaXIVzeYC9FT2lJf9-66z4xeAnUCx9VQQWawD-VoDCWoORuxcFRtfBF54-il87DXta_BWeqJT1--YaXocpxLe_jha-rUYPhznUfk57h_sSDXE1iJs1mQD1u5XgCw9pXSfnRN9Ex4K9WlXEUyf45V8VxO7JZZ3A?width=790&height=277&cropmode=none)
