- strong relationship with national brands :+1:

	- giving them access to premium higher quality items with higher margins

	- strong relationship with Nike, integrated membership program

- substantial real estate portfolio, their stores are core to their Omni channel strategy :+1:

	- 70% of online orders are picked up at stores

	- store within a store

- Even as Nike is cutting its sale to wholesale partners and retailers (consumer direct offense) :+1:

	- DKS remains one of their strong partners, even integrating their membership programs

	- nike wants by 2025 to be 60% direct to consumer
![Nike Direct](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mWrX8ntty1tEm3x2bk8EiDmsE42NIJhdK2ytQkpBgUKL0Jh4HRGRLpQDpooNNNVkXCHU9Uoqh4sgqFdb-R9-kJTaDjqDK940sGA4U6JPiokSqBPHIjvAiz0tUOokwpNv5EHajDKy5H4b2lZdFM_ld9F2WuvsK-zUYq1m2L12uHBwBHG9r4VPLyORalYrpmV_R?width=698&height=422&cropmode=none)

## Risks <a name="risks"></a>

- macro economic conditions

	- slowing economic activity due to Feds tightening moneytary policy

	- no more stimulus

	- how much demand was pull forward by the pandemic?

- are covid trends here to stay, return to office?

- continued supply chain pressures as many products are manufactuered overseas

- foreign relation tensions as well with China & Russia

- buybacks

	- 2020 they paused buybacks, and in 2021 they tried to make up the lack of purchases from previous years but the share price had gone up alot, net increase of %18 in share count! Not enough to offset :-1:

	- but it was pretty good, averageing -5% prior to pandemic

- brands are narrowing their distribution attempting to go direct to customer 

	- i.e Nike is moving towards D2C hope be have their business 60% D2C by 2025

	- but they still have a strong relationship with DKS

- success of their private label :thinking: 

- success of their specialty stores :thinking:

- significant knowledge and expierence in the Stack Family. Lauren Hobart is the 2nd CEO of DKS starting 2021

- a beneficial takeover may be hard if Stack family doesn't like it. :thinking:

	- also convertible notes has some terms and conditions that can make a take over harder

## Valuation <a name="valuation"></a>
![DCF](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mzQbWCkDByzbXsDtgOxyMlcN3sFOs6dcD3k3Bu0r44c9CjkLJPxjtXcrT7e4wRyNxIO2cYaDqaOZPxRbaTuGGEHElWRXkmp2xR8FdfhSsgfSotdjvMs3cPJiqu1pY-qJXlzUcygpHgj12mkbnSSp6ySjsxBaWhtOP1cuZNzdxE5m-WghsYBFmSft0pswof-ga?width=1266&height=451&cropmode=none)

- they expect to retain most of the margin gains since 2019 even with inflation headwinds this year

	- hence we chose an OCF margin of 7% to be ultra conservative for now

- CFO - feels how well the consumer holds up is going to be the overriding factor, more than the bottom line

- new yahoo projection indciated a low of revenue low of 9.36B vs 11B intially projection (-20% drop almost)

- look at 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q1, 7% sales drop, and their guidance is decrease of 2-8% in comp sales

	- hence we forecasting revenue drop of approx 7%

- capex input taken from their guidance of capex spending next year
