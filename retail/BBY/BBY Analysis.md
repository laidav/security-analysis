# Company (TICKER)

## Summary and Recommendation

#### Reasons to Invest

- Best Buy is the 2nd largest consumer electronics (behind AMZN) retailer and have developed a successful omni-channel and price matching strategy in the consumer electronics industry. This will provides them with superior profitability over their largest competitor AMZN.

	- Best buy stores act as distribution points for their customers whether they want to have delivery or do instore pick up. This makes BBY much more profitable than AZMN single online/delivery channel

	- Best buy prices matches so competitors won't be able to use pricing to steal customers

- Their store within a store concept cultivated strong relationship with vendors, allowing them to provide premium products and superior customer expierence compared to their competitors in the big-box retail arena.

	- BBY diffentiate themselves by focusing on service vs selling products. They focus on customer experience and making BBY the best place for manufactuerers want to be to showcase their products. 

<br>

- Mangement has done an excellent job maintaining the companies financial health and shareholders have been rewarded steadily through sensible dividend and buyback policies

Our intent is to be a premium dividend payer and to regularly repurchase shares every year that, at a minimum, offset dilution from equity-based awards. We intend to do this all while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics." :thinking: why premium dividend payer?
