# Best Buy (BBY)

## Summary and Recommendation

We believe BBY will remain a strong retailer in the consumer electronics market in the foreseeable future. It has a narrow economic moat - however this is offset by a track record of exceptional management.

In the past decade, BBY's has adapted to the e-commerce world where many of their brick-and-mortar competitors have failed. Through innovation and excellent capital management, BBY has been able to create sustainable growth, while steadily rewarding shareholders via a sensible buyback and dividend policy. 

Our target price is based a slightly higher cost of capital to mitigate risks involving BBY's narrow moat and economic uncertainty regarding consumer spending.
