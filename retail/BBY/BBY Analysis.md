# Best Buy (BBY)

## Summary and Recommendation

We believe BBY will remain a strong retailer in the consumer electronics market in the foreseeable future. It has a narrow economic moat - however this is offset by a track record of exceptional management.

In the past decade, BBY's has adapted to the e-commerce world where many of their brick-and-mortar competitors have failed. Through innovation and excellent capital management, BBY has been able to create sustainable growth, while steadily rewarding shareholders via a sensible buyback and dividend policy. 

- <b>Buy at $86.35 (based on 7.5% cost of capital)</b>
