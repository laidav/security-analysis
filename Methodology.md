## Principles <a name="principles"></a>

1. Margin of safety is <b>ALWAYS</b> required. The degree of which is determined by the quality of the business.

1. Investment decisions are guided by our valuation of the business. Not by market trends or price movements.

1. We <b>CAN NOT</b> predict price movements or what the central banks are going to do.

1. We <b>CAN</b> only be prepared by identifying good ideas and buying when the opportunities arise.

1. Sell <b>ONLY</b> IF there is something better or the holding is <b>riculously</b> overvalued.

1. Macroeconomic conditions & forecast are only taken into consideration as far as how it would affect the business of interest and its outlook.

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

<p>Look for mid to large cap companies with a good economic moat and strong track record of reinvestment returns.</p>

<p>Buy them with a sufficient margin of safety.</p>

<p>A <b>minimum</b> cost of capital 6% will apply. A higher cost of capital may be applied to further mitigate risk.</p>
