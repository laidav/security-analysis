#### Risks

- macro econmic conditions

	- inflation putting pressure on margins

	- quantitative tightening effects on consumer spending

	- a recession could hit marine and aviation hard given those industries are luxury/highly discretionary

- investments in AUTO OEM not proven yet

	- much investment and efforts in the auto OEM segment, watch the roll out of the BMW program this year and assess

<br>

- political tensions between Taiwan and PRC

	- principal manufacturing facilities in Taiwan. If PRC attempts to use military for Chinese re-unification, affects can be very negative

<br>

- rising levels of inventory could work for or against them

## Competitive Analysis <a name="competitive-analysis"></a>

#### Structural Advantages <a name="structural-advantages"></a>

- technology breadth and diversity & vertical integration

	- [Interview with CEO "justifying" manufactuering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajuOT9W2avQ)

	- They believe in their vertically integrated manufactuering facilities and distribution networks provide significant capability and flexibility to maximise use of their breadth and depth of resources to serve its diverse products and markets 

		- Cost advantage

			- allows for rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and
processes, achieving higher efficiency and resulting in lower cost

			- can leverage manufacturing resources across high, med low volume products

			- this is evident in the gross margins as GRMN outdoes their competitors
		- Quality

			- immediate feedback is available through the vertical integration that allowing development teams to do continous improvement in design and supply chain

		- Time to Market

			- multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply
chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated
ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market

- Diversified line of business

	- diversified lines of business shieled them from enourmouse macro economic and competitive pressures in 2008 time frame

	- see [Resilience](#resilience) section

- strong knowledge in dealing with highly regulated sectors i.e aviation


![Gross margin](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mneS3s68sS2QhEWlX2dzKziAq6b9Pyg3PMH0v37dRoYgKCPHC4XNnTxc5BDHvxIc7c3B9asg0UP72jnQRIXkeKSiKqOzqrWuwbxWbFNuNrUErr19Ig47QJK_i49_cnlXpIPW3Cv80tlU2Zkpv5HoDPGQQQIq4fRwUVq21D4znfNEGf9yTATHF8Y4liuLqO_rB?width=892&height=531&cropmode=none)


- Strong expierence in regulated industries

	- aviation and now gain contracts in the auto OEM segment

- Hard to find info on who is winning the fitness ecosystem

#### Performance <a name="performance"></a>
	
- gross margins from companies that compete in Garmin's industries :+1::+1::+1:

- threats 

#### PEST Analysis <a name="pest"></a>

- Political

	- Taiwan (see risk factors)

- Economic

	- Econmic downturn (see risk factors)

- Social

	- people are becoming more health concious and this trend has been strengthed by the pandemic

	- boating and fishing demographic trends are also becoming more diverse

		- [article](https://magazine.boatim.com/blog-listing/top-10-trends-shaping-us-boating-in-2022-and-beyond)

		- [article](https://linchpinseo.com/trends-boating-industry/)

		- this can serve as a headwind for GRMN's boating and fishing detection products

- Technological

	- GPS will be around for a while. 

	- there is some research on quantum compasses and other possible navigation techs

		- [article](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/188973/quantum-compass-could-allow-navigation-without/)

		- [article](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/ant-inspired-gps-navigation/)

		- these solutions try to solve the problem if satelitte signal is not available

			- i.e underground

#### Porter 5 Forces <a name="porter"></a>

- Competition

	- GRMN faces competition in each of their segments

	- they will have to continue to innovate and provide superior products to maintain/gain marketshare
		- see marketshare section

- New Entrants

	- fitness/smartwatches high barrier to entry

		- already well established names, apple,  samsung etc..

		- high intial investment into supply chain, manufacturing and product design

		- existing players already have a large user base with their data on entire ecosystems made around their fitness products
			- i.e garmin connect

			- there would be a high switching cost for consumer to leave a trusted brand and lose their fitness history

	- outdoors/marine/aviation/auto

		- Garmin is by far the marketleader in GPS techology and have a well established brand

		- Aviation OEM and auto OEM markets are also high regulated

			- expierence with highly regulated industry

			- very high R & D investments are required

			- ensuring manufactuering plants adhere to regulations


- Power of suppliers

	- some of their suppliers are their sole source

		- this could give them power to rise prices

- Power of customers
	- GRMN does have a network of retailers, and they sell direct too :+1:
	- price pressure?????


- Threat of substitute products
	- see technology in PEST Analysis

## Risks <a name="risks"></a>

- pressure on gross margins due to uptick in freight and fuel costs "inflation"

	- economic downtown can affect some of GRMN's segment particular hard, marine and aviation are particular hit hard during hard times

		- marine and aviation was not as big of their portfolio in the past, could have a bigger impact in an econmic downturn

- a lot of investment in auto OEM not yet profitable :thinking:

	- gross margin will be negatively affected as auto OEM revenue grows

	- facing headwins in the auto oem margins, making significant investments there

	- ![Segment margins](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4m_Lh8r5-YvBR4xZeiuj_YCn9se-fkTgfTm2ll4LE3JkZNYlQmAcp7P4E3plyGI4MDB7Yrzjfz2GipfA83UN1ZNjJebc_rjSuJg_BPaBpmTbz8K9YGwleffp2ajKp43SzoeI6kytozY48W_DbZZWWpJQqSf9imzkQbhvlulywtsG6dBip6t1cJyIPtlHEIsqMR?width=1228&height=455&cropmode=none)

	- 2022Q1 earnings call

		- auto OEM should scale	

		- won't be a positive a number in the near term

		- launching BMW in Q2 next gen BMW computing module platform

			- approved new factory in Poland, giving it a rare green light for mass production readiness

		- operating and gross margins showed improvement YoY in 2022Q1, it should scale and improve :+1:

	- in their 2008 Q4 call Pemble says 
	
		- "As the economic crisis continues to play out, we realize that 2009 will be one of themost difficult years in our history. In the automotive segment, we estimate that units will be flat in 2009 on a global basis due to the reduced levels of consumer spending andincreased levels of penetration, particularly in Europe. We are focused on managing our business appropriately in light of these market realities. **Our strong margins and significant reduction of inventory in the fourth quarter validate our ability to use vertical integration to appropriately scale our business in real-time**"

		- when economic times are tough, they will focus on profitability and market share

			- "In addition, we will continue to make prudent investments in research anddevelopment and introduce new product innovations that will position us for growth andnew opportunities as the economic cycle runs its course."
