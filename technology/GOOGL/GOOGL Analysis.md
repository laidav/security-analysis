- has dominance in the search engine world
![Search Engine](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4m-pQ8jkE0QgQ7afPLqUYHjwu0UlkE3-4A6_rdf8v8vyAgzD9BVJK_Iv4zNbv3s5TmQ0Mn6uK_djTLFCo2xjwbcdqtjrrFmFsV7PxcWGWgJ89Lto-HH_rYsFMaYHCkPi4_abqfrJpl6UolCPiA7JWQLDjo64tqf_cmCZGdPTh_8PB0S-c8locTN5aSHVfAQ_7R?width=1227&height=691&cropmode=none)

- if they lose some retail PPC ads to AMZN they are still overwhelming dominant in the search space for services and other businesses

- they have innovated and created an echo system that gives them dominance in the internet search world making them the market leader for digitial advertising

	- chrome browser

	- android operating system

	- google play store

	- gmail

	- google maps etc...

- threats 

	- losing some digital add spend share to amazon on PPC retail items :-1:

	- Amazons advertising and PPC is growing, and starting video advertising as well :-1:

	- tiktok short videos taking online video ads :-1:
![Amazon ad revenue](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mXbz1eAQ6MVUJlAzijud0g6ZoTAqzy5eILLzuYM5t48GnWGuH5OhVAz04LphaXvaLORtHpzWwqSvnYXy1mfbE8E8te7gk5vauw6-HRsORT9d81wXwMZOrXKLPiWY1YdwYLs5mqp4M6DMJBvAKCjqOmoRKFTuS25zyD_j5k3ozTrQGDexDhdxm8ThkyBe9hTIt?width=741&height=431&cropmode=none)


## Risks <a name="risks"></a>

- macro economic condition - possible recession on horizon

	- see resilence section to see affect on revenues and profits

	- digital spend in recession?
![Digital Ad spend history](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mhATAiAPgwRQ5vQJoj2Jd-pHjcKPlmDb3A7KCoG0pB5D1lSx7LfWRev6BpM5VSxB0lCjqsQ5KeB29UNDETqyevMpljfZAXlwoN-gZlzDrlppQlaKCHFug4ctLBWZ6iDkqahFMOokUQkZHXcCV0TABKikN1cgCg-Ria0gXw5cIiLlzg_BeXdHWO2lbSTmdnr6e?width=1200&height=2885&cropmode=none)

		- only had a slowing growth affect in 2008

- competitor search engine - although google handles ~95% of internet searches, a competitor entering this space would have a huge impact on their ads service which account for 80% of their revenue :-1: 

	- not a very diverse revenue stream :-1:

- AMZN gaining share in the PPC category for retail :-1:

- online video headwinds, tiktok and other short form videos are claiming ad spend :-1:

- digital advertising spend moving away from search to other mediums

- investment in their cloud business may not pay off :-1:

	- they have quite the uphill battle with Microsoft and AWS

- performance MAX

- [google anti trust history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NK-rlCJGEM)

- need manufacterers to adopt their products and services - evalulate TAC

- Capital Allocation?

	- buybacks - they are not really returning cash to shareholders in this respect, although they have annouced a buyback program, there is no definite commitment

		- could be good if they buyback a lot at a lower price :thinking:

- marketable securities - they have a substantial amount of liquidity in marketable securities
![Marketable Securities](https://dsm01pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mqAh0aFHx2AH7OTEOiIttXt-V2UBLJpVkIgNJjDjB3nvGrHuGZoh_PiReq83S9bjpBeHZZB3tX-U8fi6LQMXhL8tRfPJ1qnPvR8Ll2VSDFo5gsTlenQO7ehiGeG03SeYZAvKhhfSj8Mp-s4bh_AX9hoxsrSFoRMyTE7AF1LVgQ-rJsOYChqWhte_CzP4L-OTc?width=1352&height=108&cropmode=none)

	- but YTD S&P500 lost 14% where as their securities only lost -4.73%, maybe their investments are less risky?

- intellectual property

	- PageRank patent expired

## Valuation <a name="valuation"></a>

- revenue growth rates
	- before 2020 , some revenue headwinds
	- see risk factors above, modest slow in growth rate in 2008 recession
	- choosing conservative growth rate of 15%

- ocf margins
	- choosing an average of 31%
	- TAC % has been on a steady trend downwards :+1:
		- some increase in 2017 due to mobile phone space

	- S & M % down :+1:

- FCF
	- tailwind 

- FCF Margin
	- similar to OCF
	
- reinvestment returns, w & without R & D

	- R & D as % of revenue

		- pretty steady at ~14%

	- Capex as % of revenue

		- pretty steady at ~14%

- Buyback efficiency score?

- FCF Distribution rate

- Assumptions

		- travel searches seem to be back up more than pre pandemic levels

			- working to help their travel partners heavily

		- PERFORMANCE MAX

			- one campaign to link to all of google services, search, maps, discovery, youtube etc..

			- [Performance max review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRrbyg-mCfA)

				- limited control, cant control key words, canibalizing his own brand

				- its not reaching new people because it was all based on brand search

			- [Another review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gwq95xRoIvg) 

				- also mentions limited insight compared to previous compaigns

				- i.e search term campaign you can see keyword details

				- more heavily relying on AI and less user inputs to control

				- you have less control and trusting your budget with google ads since there is less customization compared to the stand alone campaigns

		- people are finding a balance of online and in person shopping

			- "shopping near me" search term is quite balanced

		- UNREALIZED LOSS OF $1.2B in securities due to market volitility :-1:

		- direct response ads moderating growth compared to brand ads

		- decline in Google Play y o y because of price changes

		- TAC up 23%

		- tough comp in Q2

		- suspended activity in Russia

		- 70B dollar buyback authorized

		- in 2021 1% of google's revenues were from russia (advertising)

		- margins benefited last year from the timing of revenue growth vs expense growth

		- youtube ads had more affect from the russian war vs google ads

		- slight headwin as shorts take a bigger precentage of youtube view time

			- still testing monetization with shorts

		- didn't really answer question about tiktok and shorts

		- cyber security is particular focus (CEO)

		- sunsetting old version of google analytics

			- deprecation of cookies in chrome?
